1. Real-Time Secure Communication Protocols for Embedded Systems
2.
---Objective (why?)
The project’s goal is to identify which protocol design best balances security vs. timing for constrained embedded nodes.
---Background (who? where?)
This is highly relevant for teams building industrial IoT, robotics, smart energy, and building automation systems where small MCUs communicate over constrained/low-power links. CoAP is specifically designed for constrained nodes and lossy networks.
---Methodology (how? when?)
Over ~8 weeks, measure latency/jitter/deadline misses plus CPU/RAM/energy under normal and attack conditions.
---Expected results (what?)
A reproducible benchmark dataset (latency/jitter/resource/security outcomes).
---Cost
2–3 dev boards (ESP32/STM32/RP2040 mix): $30–$120

USB-UART/debug accessories: $15–$40

Breadboard/wires/passives: $10–$25

Optional power meter: $20–$60

Optional network tool (logic analyzer/sniffer dongle): $20–$60
Estimated total: $55–$305
